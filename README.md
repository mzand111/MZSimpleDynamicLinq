# MZSimpleDynamicLinq


This code is the base code for these nuget packages:

MZSimpleDynamicLinq.Core
MZSimpleDynamicLinq.Extensions
MZSimpleDynamicLinq.EFCoreExtensions
MZSimpleDynamicLinq.HttpRequestExtensions

The idea behind MZSimpleDynamicLinq is to provide a data structure and tools to for paging, sorting and filtering functionality in .Net.
Using this package will no more need to expose IQueryable and similar technology-intensive structures to your domain object/services to the above layers.
This provides you more control on what you are yielding from your services to the outside world.

To get more familier you can watch a set of videos at youtube.com. 
There I have explained the goal of this code and also how I have develped it and also a sample with jQuery datatable from datatables.net as the UI component.
